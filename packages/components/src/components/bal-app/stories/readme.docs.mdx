only be one `<bal-app>` element per project. An app can have many Design System
components. The overlay components get appended to the `<bal-app>` when they are
presented. put users in control of showing or hiding content. Accordions also
help us organize information to keep screens less cluttered so that users can
accomplish tasks in short, intuitive steps. And accordions can help users find
content they need. The component can be used standalone, in combination or
inside bal-card.
