# Why a Design System

"The need for `Design Systems` goes hand in hand with the need for scale, efficiency, and consistency in Design."

[Design Systems: benefits, challenges & solutions](https://uxdesign.cc/design-systems-62f648c6dccf)

## Problem Space

### Internal

- Big corporates have complex organisational structures (many involved stakeholders)
- Difficult collaboration between teams (IT, design, business units, marketing, sales etc.)
- Collaboration more difficult for working with distributed teams (office/country) & working with external partners

**Result:** Island solutions are build!

### External

- Brand integrity gets disturbed
- Loss of credibility
- Loss of trust

**Result:** Interrupted Customer Journey leads to less revenue

## Solution Space

Create a [Design System](https://stenciljs.com/docs/what-is-design-system) (collection of reusable components with rules, principles and constraints for the design development).

### Internal

- Standardisation leads to less frictional losses, more efficiency & easier collaboration
- Better UX-quality through consistency
- Reduce costs/errors & improve time-to-market

**Result:** Reduce costs/errors & improve time-to-market

### External

- Clear communication of the brand integrity
- More credibility
- More trust

**Result:** Optimised customer journey leads to more sales!

## Advantages

In this section key advantes of the library are listed which are part of the Baloise Design System.

### 📦 Agnostic

Perhaps one of the most appealing benefits of using Web Components is the flexibility to choose the underlying tools and frameworks (including their versions). To facilitate the effort of teams to use one unified standard based on Web Components, every team has complete freedom in choosing the tools they love today and will love tomorrow.

#### Framework Support

The Baloise Design System can be used with any Web-Technolgy, however we deliver a deticated library for Angular, Vue and React with proxy components.

> For more integration documentation like react or svelte go to the stencil documentation about [Framework Integration](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).

### 🎨 Fast style changes

Today, every change to the corperate styleguide has to be implemented by each development team. This costs a lot of effort and generates unnecessary costs. Let's imagine that a color has to be changed and buttons have to be made flat. With the Baloise Design System only the according [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) varibles have to be changed.

```scss
$blue: red;
$radius: 0;
```

The changes will be released to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@baloise/design-system-components) from where development teams can grap new changes.
Only the library has to be upgraded by every project and style changes are immediately applied.
Style changes will not change the component interface, meaning that the developers don't have to do any additional adjustment.

### ⚡️ Fast Runtime

[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Web_Components) offered a solution by pushing more work to the browser for better performance. Moreover, the components get lazy loaded when they need. To keep the initial package size of your project as small as possible.

#### Browser Support

The Library supports the following browsers. For more details go to [Stencil - Browser Support](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support).

### 🛠️ Rich Features

On top of the user interaction and style part, the library also provides a set of utilities.

#### Testing

As a [E-2-E testing](?path=/docs/getting-started-testing--page) tool we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). With the help of our custom and overriden commands we try to simplify writing tests.
The commands hide the complexity of the component and only serve as an interface for simulated user actions like a click.

```typescript
import { dataTestSelector } from '@baloise/design-system-testing'

describe('Button', () => {
  it('should ...', () => {
    const button = dataTestSelector('button-id')
    cy.get(button).contains('Label').click()
  })
})
```
