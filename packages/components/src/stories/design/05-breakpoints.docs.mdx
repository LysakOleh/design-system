## Sass mixins

There are nine responsive mixins, which can be easly used in your sass files.

Use the scss mixins in your application the following:

```css
@import 'node_modules/@baloise/design-system-components/src/styles/global.utilities';

.bal-element {
  width: 100%;
}

@include tablet() {
  .bal-element {
    width: 380px;
  }
}

@include desktop() {
  .bal-element {
    width: 570px;
  }
}
```

The file `global.utilities` provides all defined scss variables like [colors](?path=/docs/design-colors--page) and also the mixins.

## CSS Helper Classes

Out of the responsive tokens a collection of helper css classes is created.
