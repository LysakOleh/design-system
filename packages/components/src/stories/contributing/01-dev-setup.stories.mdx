# Dev Setup

Baloise Design System is divided into multiple NPM packages. Development for all of the packages happens inside one mono repository. Follow the below steps to get the dev environment up and running.

## Prerequisite - NodeJS

To work with this project a recent LTS version of NodeJS and npm is required. Make sure you've installed and/or updated [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) before continuing.

> **Warning!**
> Note that you will need to use npm 6 or higher.

## Components

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baloise/design-system.git design-system
cd design-system
```

- Run `npm run setup` in the root directory to install libraryâ€™s dependencies and its packages
- Run `npm run start` to serve Design System storybook

> The demo page will be served at `http://localhost:6006/` by default

For more commands visit [Commands](?path=/docs/contributing-commands--page)

> **TIP**
> All Baloise Design System packages and their respective code can be found under `/packages/`. For example components live in `/packages/components/`.

## Documentation

To document our components we use the tool [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

The documentation files are in a folder called `/stories` or have `.stories.` in the file name.
