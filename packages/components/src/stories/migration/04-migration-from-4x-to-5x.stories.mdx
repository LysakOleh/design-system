# Migration from 4.x to 5.x

The following workflow walks through the steps of migrating from version 2.x to 3.x.
Note that the actual steps required for your project may vary, and these steps should be treated as general guidance rather than strict instructions.

The component `bal-app` lost his props, due better intrgration for our proxy libraries.

## App

We removed the props `background` and `hasStickyFooter`.

```html
<!-- - old -->
<bal-app has-sticky-footer background></bal-app>

<!-- + new -->
<bal-app class="has-sticky-footer has-background-grey-1"></bal-app>
...
```
